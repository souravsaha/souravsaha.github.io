Hi, I am a PhD student at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata advised by [Prof. Mandar Mitra](https://www.isical.ac.in/~mandar/) and [Dr. Debapriyo Majumdar](https://www.isical.ac.in/~debapriyo/). My research focuses on the Explainability and Interpretability of Information Retrieval. A brief overview of our research can be found in the [Publications](https://souravsaha.github.io/publications/) section.
