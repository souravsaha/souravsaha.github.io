Hi, I am a PhD student at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata advised by [Prof. Mandar Mitra](https://www.isical.ac.in/~mandar/) and [Dr. Debapriyo Majumdar](https://www.isical.ac.in/~debapriyo/). Our work is supported by a [TCS RSP fellowship](https://www.tcs.com/who-we-are/newsroom/press-release/research-scholarship-program-computer-science-phds-india). My research focuses on the Explainability and Interpretability of Information Retrieval Systems. 
I visited [Avishek Anand](https://www.avishekanand.com/) and the [Web Information Systems research group](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/) at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) during November and December 2024. A brief overview of our research can be found in the [Publications](https://souravsaha.github.io/publications/) section.
